            Genshin Impact is an open-world action role-playing game that allows the player to control one of four interchangeable characters in a party. The player can control their character and perform actions such as running, climbing, swimming, and sliding, all limited by stamina. Some characters possess abilities that can alter the environment, such as freezing water to create an ice path that can help the player traverse terrain. The map features teleportation points that allow the player to move quickly.
