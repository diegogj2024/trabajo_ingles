      <p class="card__description">Before, when she was a single being, Foçalors, the Goddess of Justice, separated her divinity from her body and spirit, leaving behind her human self, Furina.
          Furina was cursed with immortality as long as her divine self continued to exist, and she had to oversee Fontaine as the interim Hydro Archon for 500 years to carry out the true Archon’s plan to deceive the Celestial Order and save Fontaine from a great prophecy.
          After the execution of Foçalors and the destruction of the Divine Throne of the Hydro Archon, Furina left her role and now lives her life as an ordinary human.</p>
